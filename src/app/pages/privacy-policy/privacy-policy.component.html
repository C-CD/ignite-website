			<strong>Third-Party Sites</strong>
			<p>The Site may contain content that is supplied by a third-party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Site are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Site you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.

			<p>The Site may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on the Site and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Site and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Site and other apps and sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. The Site’s third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies, web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioural Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>
